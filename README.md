Utility functions to handle multilingual URLs

## Scope

Personal. These are just some utility functions to handle a multilingual frontend app, including having the language in the URL. I tried to make it as agnostic as possible but the truth is this that this was made with my workflow in mind so I don't guarantee it will work for you. It may give you some ideas and help you though.

## Support

Compatible and designed to work with Next.js and Prismic.

## Stack

Typescript
